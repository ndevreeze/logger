# logger

Minimal Clojure logging library, mainly for scripting 

## Installation

Leiningen/Boot

    [ndevreeze/logger "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

Clojure CLI/deps.edn

    ndevreeze/logger {:mvn/version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"}

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/ndevreeze/logger.svg)](https://clojars.org/ndevreeze/logger)

## Usage

First initialise the logger:

    (log/start! "/tmp/foo.log" :debug)
  
or:

    (log/start! nil :debug)
  
Then log at different levels:

    (log/error "A different logfile, error level")
    (log/warn "warn level")
    (log/debug "One line at debug level")
    (log/info "At info level")

## Developing

### Testing

    $ lein midje

or:

    $ lein repl (or start in Cider)
    (use 'midje.repl)
    (autotest)
    
### Bugs

* No known errors, but see Todo below.

### Todo

* Should use Log4j v2, now using v1.
* Log to stderr; now logging to stdout, something with ConsoleAppender
